Hi <%= @reservation.name %>,

Thanks for making a reservation for Skint. The place you reserved was:
  <%= @reservation.ticket_type.description %>
  Price: <%= @reservation.ticket_type.formatted_price %>

We haven't yet received your payment, so this is just a friendly reminder that
you need to make sure to pay us by <%= l @reservation.payment_due %>,
otherwise we may make your place available to someone else.

There's a chance that you may have already made your payment and we just
haven't noticed it yet (we have to manually keep it updated). If you received
this email, but you think that you have paid then please let us know.

<% if @reservation.payment_method == 'cheque' %>
You can pay by posting us a cheque for the appropriate amount, made payable to
'Skint', to:

Skint c/o David Heath
Flat 7, 14-16 Sedgwick St
London E9 6AE
<% else %>
You can make your payment using this link:

  <%= reservation_success_url(@reservation.reference) %>
<% end %>

If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to drop us an email on
skint.dance@gmail.com.

Best wishes

The Skint Team
