The bals will feature a mix of music and dance traditions, from different individuals and groups.

Of course, after the 'official' evening bals are over, the music and dancing will go on until the early hours!
		
There may also be additional workshops slotted in here and there, as time permits. In the past weâ€™ve had last-minute workshops in Kazakh dance, Norwegian tunes, nyckelharpa techniques and more... Let us know if you'd like to teach something during the weekend.
