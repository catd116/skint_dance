Hi <%= @reservation.name %>,

Thanks for signing up for Skint. You requested the following:
  
  <% [@reservation.ticket_type].each do |type| %>
  <%= type.description %> - <%= type.formatted_price %>
  <% end %>

If you want tickets for more than one person, you'll need to place a separate
order for each person.
<% if @reservation.payment_due.present? %>
You have until <%= l @reservation.payment_due %> to pay for your reservation
before we release your place to someone else.
<% else %>
We'd be grateful if you could make your payment as soon as you can, thanks!
<% end %>

To confirm your order, please pay online using this link:

  <%= reservation_success_url(@reservation.reference) %>

If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to drop us an email on
skint.dance@gmail.com.

Best wishes

The Skint Team
