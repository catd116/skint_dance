Hi <%= @day_ticket_order.name %>,

Thanks for ordering Skint day tickets. You requested the following:
  
  <% @day_ticket_order.ticket_types.each do |type| %>
  <%= type.description %> - <%= type.formatted_price %>
  <% end %>

If you want tickets for more than one person, you'll need to place a separate
order for each person.

To confirm your order, please pay online using this link:

  <%= day_ticket_order_url(@day_ticket_order) %>

You can also pay on arrival (but advance payment is preferred if you can).

If you have any problems or questions, don't hesitate to drop us an email on
skint.dance@gmail.com.

Best wishes

The Skint Team
